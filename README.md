Caesar Cipher

Introduction

This project implements a Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a straightforward and widely recognized encryption method. It's a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext shifts a certain number of places up or down the alphabet. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher serves as an effective educational tool for grasping the fundamentals of encryption and cryptography.

Features

- Encrypt Text: Moves each letter in the plaintext a defined number of positions to produce ciphertext.
- Decrypt Text: Reverses the shift to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext.
- Customizable Shift: Permits the user to determine the shift magnitude for both encryption and decryption.
